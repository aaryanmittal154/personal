      "I got this internship through networking with a highly established Silicon Valley entrepreneur, Mr. Kamran Elahian. At LetsMOD, my primary focus was on automating the workflow for creating 3D character heads using AI, which streamlined the process and reduced manual effort. Additionally, I played a crucial role in managing the Discord server, which was integrated with the company’s systems to build AI-generated 3D memes, similar to Midjourney. During my time at LetsMOD, the company filed its third patent, related to Company AI, an area I was actively involved in exploring.",

      "Built a B2B e-commerce platform from ground up with three other cofounders. FFKart simplified the supply chain for B2B agricultural products delivery within four hours with making a marketplace for all the Suppliers. I worked on the website frontend, personally interviewed over 100 employees and hired over 10 employees. I immersed myself in every aspect of the operations, including the labor-intensive tasks of procuring products directly from wholesale markets. I studied various supply-chain courses and made the operations efficient. Additionally, I also managed the finance for the startup. We would do delivery worth 3000 USD by the end of the second month of operations. The startup got closed as my other two co-founders turned out to have lied their backgrounds and experience. They used these fabrications to manipulate business decisions and gain majority control.",

      "We initially came up with a complex idea to track carbon emissions in real-time by gaining full access to mobile data. However, after pitching to 10 VCs, one challenged us to simplify our approach and focus on providing a meaningful user experience by removing carbon guilt through tree planting. This feedback prompted us to pivot and develop a basic digital carbon calculator, which we launched within a week on a $10 budget. We cold emailed professors at Stanford and Berkeley, who generously provided us with essential resources to build the calculator for free. We then actively promoted Project Neutralize at environmental events across the Bay Area, directly engaging with users. The website is still active but I do not work actively on it.",

I also managed the PostgreSQL database for users and letters, and created a seamless user interface using React.

We noticed that local retailers were charging high markups on gloves, so we decided to cut out the middleman. By buying directly from a small manufacturer, we offered a better price to the manufacturing industry with zero need for inventory space. Running the business over the summer, we managed to turn a profit of 20,000 INR with no initial investment. It also made me realise, the importance of negotiation and hustle required to keep a business running.",
